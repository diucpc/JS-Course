# Problem-3

Abul and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and \$268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator.

He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than 50 BDT, 15% when the bill is between 50 BDT and 200 BDT, and 10% if the bill is more than 200 BDT.
